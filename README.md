# Bash-Desktop-Background-Change-Script-Prank
Prank script =) XD

this is a prank cript to change the background of your colleagues/ friends from the terminal you can clone the file in the ".cshrc"
so that they may not be able to locate the file and have them change the background every time the terminal is run 

have fun responsibly!
